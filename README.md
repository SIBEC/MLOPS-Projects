# MLOPS-Projects
This repository is a collection of hands-on MLOps projects showcasing end-to-end machine learning workflows, from data ingestion to deployment. Each project demonstrates a critical component of the MLOps lifecycle using industry-standard tools like Airflow, MLflow, BentoML, Kafka, and Docker.

1️⃣ Airflow IoT Data Pipeline (airflow-learn)

Tech: Apache Airflow, Docker

Highlights: Orchestrates IoT sensor data generation and aggregation using Airflow DAGs and XComs. Demonstrates workflow scheduling and containerized deployment.

2️⃣ Model Deployment with BentoML (bentoml)

Tech: BentoML, Docker

Highlights: Serves machine learning models as REST APIs with versioning and reproducibility. Demonstrates portable ML services in production-like environments.

3️⃣ Experiment Tracking with MLflow (mlflow-learn)

Tech: MLflow Tracking & Models

Highlights: Tracks experiments, parameters, metrics, and artifacts. Enables model registry and reproducible workflows for ML development.

4️⃣ Real-time Data Streaming with Kafka (kafka-learn)

Tech: Apache Kafka, Python

Highlights: Simulates real-time IoT data streaming with Kafka producers and consumers. Showcases event-driven architectures in ML pipelines.

5️⃣ End-to-End ML Pipeline (end-to-end-capstone)

Tech: Airflow, MLflow, Docker, Python

Highlights: A complete ML workflow covering data ingestion, training, experiment tracking, and deployment. Demonstrates integration of multiple MLOps tools in a single pipeline.
